# ADM_Comparison

The purpose of this project is to create a tool that allows a user to compare
various spatial data side by side. Particularly spatial data from the geoboundaries.org website and other spatial data open source boundaries. <br/>
In the preview below, the geoboundaries spatial data is the one on the right and is being compared against spatial data from another site
