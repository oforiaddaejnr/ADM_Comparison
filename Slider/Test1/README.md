# Test1

This provides the user with 2 different tile layers and a slider to compare both.
The user can choose what country to plot on the map, but the problem is, the plotted map
covers both tilelayers at the same time instead of one. The reason being, both tile layers are 
overlapped on one map, and both tile layers have the same z index
